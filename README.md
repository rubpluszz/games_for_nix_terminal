A game to run in the Linux terminal. To start, use the "cars_4" file. If the game doesn't start, compile it for your system.
The game can be compiled on all Unix-like distributions (theoretically also on "MacOS X"). Note: To run under Windows, 
you need to modify the code (change library names, comment on some features, and replace them with standard ones for Windows)
